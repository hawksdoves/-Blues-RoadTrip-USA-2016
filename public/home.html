<h1>My USA Road Trip</h1>

<p>Since 2009, I have dreamt about going on a blues trail, from New Orleans to Chicago.
  <br>My inspiration: Johnny Lee Hooker, B.B.King and Robert Johnson (to name a few artists, plus genres).
  <br>I have made no fixed plans, route or driving licence for this road trip, just a general idea of heading North, along the Mississppi, so will update as and when I stumble across my next adventure (or blues bar).

<h5>Wish me luck!</h5>
